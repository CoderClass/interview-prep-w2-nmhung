## iPrep Week 2: Big O and Hashtables

* **Big O Notation**: Describing an algorithm's complexity
* **Hashtables**: Stores data with key value pairs

What you will submit:
- A GitHub repo with this README file (with the boxes checked).
- Create a GIF showing your Interviewbit dashboard (see below) showing exercises you've done.

### Required tasks

**Big O Notation**

- [ ] Watch [Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)(8m)
  - I have learned that there are fours notation:
    * Different steps get added. i.g: step 1 has O(n), step 2 has O(n) then we have O(n+n).
    * Drop constants. Do not describe things as O(2n) or O(3n) because it is quadratic relationship.
    * Different inputs, different variables.
    * Drop non-dominate terms.
- [ ] Read [Big O Notation in plain English](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/what-is-a-plain-english-explanation-of-big-o-notation) and write down what you learned from it
  - I have learned that Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.
     * relative: you can only compare apples to apples. 
     * representation: Big-O (in its simplest form) reduces the comparison between algorithms to a single variable.
     * complexity: Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else.
  - Addition operation: The complexity (being the number of operations) is directly proportional to the number of digits n in the larger number. We call this O(n) or linear complexity.
  - subtraction operation: is similar addition except you may need to borrow instead of carry.
  - Multiplication operation: As the algorithm scales with n-squared, this is O(n2) or quadratic complexity.
    We only care about the most significant portion of complexity.
  - When we search element in an array, if it odered, then O(log n) (binary search), if it unordered then O(n).
 
- [ ] Visit http://bigocheatsheet.com/ and think about how useful it could be to you
  - This sheet makes more sense to me now /OR/ This sheet does not make sense to me.
- [ ] Watch LogN in 5m: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjDR1NBB9MU
  - I have learned that...
  
**Hashtables**

- [ ] Read [InterviewCake Hashtable](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/hash-map?)
- [ ] Watch concept video: [HackerRank Video: Hash Tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs0KM3wKv8) (6m)

Extras: 
- [ ] [Introducing Hash Tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfhjkfocRR0) (7m)
- [ ] [Hash Table Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke_tII6Y0GE) (7m)

**Coding**

- [ ] Set up an account on Interviewbit.com and start the [Programming course](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)
- [ ] Finish at least 2 tasks on Exercism
